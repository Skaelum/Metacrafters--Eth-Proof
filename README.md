# Metacrafters--Eth-Proof
Description - A transaction based walled 
I walk through the requirements and implementation of my final assessment project for the health proof course. I explain the contract specifications, functions like mint and burn, and demonstrate the deployment process. Viewers are encouraged to follow along as I showcase the code and functionalities of the project.

# Installation
This code can be downloaded as a .sol file from this repository, making sure the versions are in check with the version of solidity you are using. 

# Execution 
You need to fir compile the code in remix, then make necessary updates in the deploy section of the code and make it run accordingtly 

# Advice 
Make sure the transactional wallet and the one you want to burn or mint coins have the same temporary wallet id provided by reminx on one of the servers.
